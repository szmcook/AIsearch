OVERVIEW

I need to produce:

AlgAbasic.py    basic implementation of AlgA
AlgBbasic.py    basic implementation of AlgB
AlgAenhanced.py enhanced implementation of AlgA
AlgBenhanced.py enhanced implementation of AlgB

10 tours for each of AlgA and AlgB: one for each city set (in city-files)
these should detail the best tours found with either implementation of that algorithm
the tours need to be in a specifically named and formatted tour file.
there will be 20 files.

a one-page proforma edited with microsoft word but exported as a pdf
this should describe my enhancement to the basic algorithms.

MARK SCHEME

marks are awarded for;
(max 10)    sophistication of the algorithms implemented (maximum tarriff of the correct basic implementations)
(max 4)     correctness of the basic implementations (4 marks if A AND B produce valid tours)
(max 6)     enhancements made (3 available for A and 3 for B if correct. This is decided by the proforma)
(max 8+2)   quality of the tours (sum of basic quality mark and enhanced quality mark)

the basic quality mark corresponds to how good the tours are.

for each of the 10 city sets i need to give the best tour produced by (AlgA or AlgAenhanced) and (AlgB or AlgBenhanced).
The basic quality mark (max 8) is determined by the best tour for each of the city sets regardless of whether it came from AlgA or AlgB.

The enhanced quality mark is available for each enhanced implementation if they perform much better than their basic counterpart.

TECHNICAL

enhanced implementations must be set with the same parameters (for example mutation probability, iterations, population size and so on)
these parameters should be set in a clear way at the beginning of the corresponds

all the algorithms should work with the command 'python AlgAbasic.py AISearchfile012'

no non-standard modules may be imported (skeleton.py contains a list of permissible imports)
validate_before_handin.py should be run regularly.

implementations must not take more than a minute to execute on the secret city sets.
it is probably a good idea to force termination after 50 seconds.

must run with Python 3.8 on Windows 10.
